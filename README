Polipo README
=============

WARNING: This branch is experimental and may be rebased or deleted at
any time!!

Polipo is single-threaded, non blocking caching web proxy that has
very modest resource needs.  

This is a fork with caching support for negotiated resources as
described in RFC 2616 (HTTP 1.1) and RFC 2295 (Transparent Content
Negotiation, experimental). It is early work in progress.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.  See the texinfo
manual (available as HTML after installation) for more information.

Questions about this fork should be directed to

    Urs Holzer <urs@andonyar.com>
